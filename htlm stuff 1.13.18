      <h1>What is Pollution?</h1>

    <h3>How are we harming the environment?</h3>
    <p><strong>Oil Drilling-</strong> Oil drilling is the process by which tubing is bored into the earths's surface, a pump is connnected to the tube and petroleum is extracted from underground. Our dependence of fossil fuels is a global addiction that greatly harms our world. Oil spills and offshore drilling poison marine life, the combustion of fossil fuels add to the increase atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p>
    <p><strong>Agricultual Activities-</strong> Yes even farming is major cause of pollution, they are mainly responsible for contaminating water and soil. This is caused by the increase use of pesticides following an intensive production period. Almost all pesticides are chemicals that are designed to prevent diseases and threaten animals away from the crop. Chemicals that can harm animals are very likely to harm us and any living thing.Furthermore as our population increases so does the need for agricultual production which will demand more space. This will result in the destruction of animal habitats which could lead to an extinction to some. </p>
    <p><Strong>Deforestaion-</Strong> Deforestation is the removal of a forest or a stand of trees where the land is used for non forest use.</p>
